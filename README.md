This app is called Quire App, and it´s main purpose is to save and contain your notes, so that important tasks in your schedule, as well as extras, 
are saved and easily accesible to you, and no one else, as your own notes are bound to your user profile. 
And if you don´t yet hve an account it´s very easy to sign up. 
The User Interface is friendly, and indicates clearly where to click on screen to navigate to the next "page", and when and where to start typing your notes. 
It´s the user´s choice what to type in, which fontsize and color to type with, and if one note should be deleted. 
The user can also easily scroll through the field of notes.
